WHY
===

I could not find a legit compiler for unix/osx so I made my own

I made my own converter from brainfuck to c. I will most likely be creating a new language like brainfuck -> something like brainfuck+ ;D

Feel free to use and distribute but pl0x use my name

Thanks

SCRIPTS
=======

*doit : compiles, installs and creates a hello world program
*compile : compiles the bfc program
*install : installs bfc
*uninstall : uninstalls bfc
*bfc : the utility to convert to c and compile the brainfuck code - syntax: bfc infile outfile
